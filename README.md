# ISP Customer Retention Prediction

In this project, I developed a customer retention prediction model using the XGBoost algorithm to forecast the likelihood of customer churn for an internet service provider.

The dataset, internet_service_churn.csv, contains customer demographics, service usage, and churn status.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
